		<h1>Ruot Thabac Duany</h1>
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>My name is Ruot Thabac Duany. I am a government official who happens to be passionate about software. I 
		recetntly completed a certification course on <em>Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) at Kenya Institute of 
		Management (KIM)</em>. My interest in M&E goes back to when I first started work in government as Director
		of Research and Information with the South Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission (SSACC) in 2008. M&E was the 
		missing link. I later became the Information Communication Technology (ICT) Director at the same 
		institution. SSACC as well as the whole country of South Sudan were in their formative years. Their was 
		no structure to speak of in the work place at the time and this is to put it ligtly. The situation has not
		 changed much in most respects.</p>
