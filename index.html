		<p>My name is Ruot Thabac Duany. I am a government official who happens to be passionate about software. I 
		recetntly completed a certification course on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) at Kenya Institute of 
		Management (KIM). My interest in M&E goes back to when I first started work in government as Director of 
		Research and Information with the South Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission (SSACC) in 2008. I later became 
		the Information Communication Technology (ICT) Director at the same institution. SSACC as well as the 
		whole country of South Sudan were in their formative years. Their was structure to speak of in the work 
		place and this is to put it ligtly. The situation has not changed much in most respects.</p>
